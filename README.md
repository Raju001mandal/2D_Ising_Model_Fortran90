# 2D_Ising_Model_Fortran90
This is Fortran90 program of Monte Carlo simulation using Metropolis algorithm for 2d ising model,the system shows critical temperature at T=2.26K.You can also calculate different observables like average magnetization per spin,fluctuation,average energy and specific heat etc.It also includes how to visualize the microstates using gnuplot.
